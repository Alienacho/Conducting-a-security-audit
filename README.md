# Conducting-a-security-audit
Example of security audit conducted on a fictional company

An assignment I have completed as part of the google cyber security proffesional certificate. The objective is to conduct a security audit to a fictional company, overviewing the company's assets and the controls and compliances that are put in place. Then taking the next steps to complete the audit:

* Comparing it to a checklist that has been prepared in advance, of controls and compliances from industry best practices and regulations.
* Then after coming up with the results, providing a summary of recommendations for stakeholders to review.
